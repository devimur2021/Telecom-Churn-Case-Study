## General Information
Build a model to predict factors leading to churn in Telecom industry
-Predict Whether high value customers will churn or not
-Identify strong predictors of churn  
- Dataset         : train.csv
- Data Dictionay  : Data_Description.pdf


## Objective
Build a Model to identify variables influencing churn in Telecom Industry. To understand the pricing dynamics in a new market
The company wants to know:

- Which variables are significant in affecting the churn probability
- Which category of customers (high/low value customers) churn or not

## Approach
Steps followed in the data analysis
- Load the data
- Inspect the data
- Perform EDA
  - Data Cleaning
  - Handle Missing Data
  - Handle Outlier
  - Sanity Check
  - Generate Dervied metrics
  - UniVariate Analysis
  - BiVariate Analysis
  - Segmented UniVariate Analysis
 -Split Data to Train and Test
 -Build multiple Models to evaluate the 
  - 
  - Tuning hyperparameter 
      - Ridge
      - Lasso
  -Evaluate the model
